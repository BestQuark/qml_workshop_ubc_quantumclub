# UBC Quantum Club Workshop: Quantum Machine Learning ‚öõÔ∏èü§ñ

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the Quantum Machine Learning workshop organized by the UBC Quantum Club. The workshop covers both classical machine learning and quantum machine learning techniques. The main goal of this workshop is to provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning algorithms and how to apply quantum computing concepts to enhance their performance.

## Workshop Contents

1. **Classical Machine Learning**
    - Introduction to machine learning concepts and Python libraries
    - Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and splitting data into training and test sets
    - Supervised learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels
    - Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
    - Exercise: Kernel comparison with SVM

2. **Quantum Machine Learning**
    - Introduction to quantum computing concepts and quantum machine learning
    - Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)
    - Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)
    - Comparison of classical and quantum machine learning techniques
    - Hands-on exercises with quantum machine learning algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To follow along with the workshop, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with linear algebra and quantum mechanics concepts
- An understanding of classical machine learning algorithms (optional, but helpful)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BestQuark/qml_workshop_ubc_quantumclub
    ```

2. Install Anaconda or Miniconda to set up a virtual environment and manage packages.

3. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10:
    ```
    conda create -n qml-workshop python=3.10
    ```

4. Activate the conda environment:
    ```
    conda activate qml-workshop
    ```

5. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```
    cd qml_workshop_ubc_quantumclub
    ```

6. Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and run the workshop notebooks:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   or
    ```
    jupyter lab
    ```

Now you're ready to start working with the workshop materials. Open the Jupyter notebooks and follow the instructions provided in each notebook.
